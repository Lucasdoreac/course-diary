## Today's Learning Goals

1. Understanding the concept of limits
2. Exploring function continuity
3. Reviewing fundamental function properties

## Key Insights

Today's class introduced the foundational concepts of calculus. The most interesting aspect was understanding how limits help us analyze function behavior at critical points.

### Example Problem

```python
# Python code to visualize a limit
def f(x):
    return (x**2 - 1)/(x - 1)

# As x approaches 1, f(x) approaches 2
```

## Challenges Faced

- Initially struggled with the formal definition of limits
- Needed extra practice with piece-wise functions

## Progress Made

- [x] Completed all in-class exercises
- [x] Understood basic limit properties
- [ ] Still need to review epsilon-delta proofs

## Tomorrow's Goals

1. Review epsilon-delta proofs
2. Start working on homework problems
3. Create visualization for piece-wise functions

## Additional Notes

The professor recommended some great online resources for practice. I found the geometric interpretation of limits particularly helpful in understanding the concept.
