## Course Priority Analysis

After reviewing the progress.json, I noticed that C치lculo is marked as priority #1 in pending tasks. Here's my plan for tackling this subject:

### Current Status
- Subject: C치lculo
- Priority: High (1/2 in pending tasks)
- Status: In Progress
- Next Action: Create and organize course materials

### Learning Resources
1. Main Course Materials:
   - Textbook references
   - Course slides
   - Practice problems
   - GeoGebra visualizations

2. Interactive Tools:
   - Math visualization software
   - Online calculators
   - Graphing tools
   - Practice platforms

### Study Strategy

#### Week 1-2: Foundations
- Review basic concepts
- Set up visualization tools
- Create study schedule
- Organize practice materials

#### Week 3-4: Core Concepts
- Focus on limits and continuity
- Practice with derivatives
- Work through example problems
- Create visual aids

#### Week 5-6: Advanced Topics
- Study integration techniques
- Apply concepts to real problems
- Prepare for assessments
- Review and refinement

### Action Items

- [ ] Set up daily study schedule
- [ ] Organize digital resources
- [ ] Create practice problem database
- [ ] Prepare visualization tools
- [ ] Schedule review sessions

### Notes and Observations

The subject requires strong foundation in:
1. Algebraic manipulation
2. Function understanding
3. Geometric interpretation
4. Logical reasoning

Will focus on building these skills alongside main course content.
